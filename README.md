# MailBox_Project

Description: The aim of the project is to design and realize a mailbox manager. The mailbox manager handles classical
user mailboxes and a common newsgroup which may be read by every user. A directory manages the users which
may access the mailbox and their rights to access different mailboxes. Only some users have the right to send
messages to the common newsgroup.

Group members: Abdallah Sobehy, Mostafa Fateen

The project is realised as a part of the "Middleware for distributed systems" module, in Msc M2 Computer and Communication Networks in Telecom SudParis.

Supervised by: Sophie CHABRIDON, Chantal TACONET.
